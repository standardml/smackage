Smackage would eventually like to enjoy the bounty of smackage itself - being 
able to rely on other sources of library code! But unless we're distributing
binaries, this leads to a problematic bootstrapping problem. This directory is
where we put code that we should be able to get via smackage someday, mostly
taken from CMlib.
